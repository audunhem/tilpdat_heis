Network ideas

We need:
1. Initialize function
	Establishes contact with the network
	Starts broadcasting. should it return something to tesll that it was a success or not? Yeah?
	should it then start pinging a "ImAlive" at a given frequencey once initialized?


2. Broadcast function
	Into this function a channel is passed, we listen to the channel and broadcast on

3. Receive function
	Also a channel is passed to this function and it should put whatever it receives on the appropriate channel


Probably the message decoding/encoding can be encapsuled in this module ye?
